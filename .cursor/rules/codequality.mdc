# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information

Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes

Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies

Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback

Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions

Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries

Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions

Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations

Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code

Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits

Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks

Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates

Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links

Always provide links to actual source code files (e.g., .py, .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx, .html, .css, .json, .yaml, .toml, .md) that exist in the codebase, not placeholder references like "x.md" or generic file names. Links should point to specific, verifiable files that can be accessed and modified.

## No Current Implementation

Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
